===========

Here's my configuration repository for tmux and it's dependencies ⚙️

## FTree explanation

This repo can be separated into 3 sections ⬇️
1. the `conf` dir which stores the tmux config file;
2. the `tars` dir which stores the source tars;
3. the `unpacked` dir which isn't here, but will be generated during
   the installation.

## The source

All sources were taken from the official repositories/links:
- `tmux`: https://github.com/tmux/tmux
- `libevent`: https://libevent.org/
- `ncurses`: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html

> [!NOTE]
>
> All sources are latest version so far. _(28, May - 2025)_

## Extra dependencies

As I've said, this is a guide to install from source code, so... some
dependencies are required:
- openssl-devel
- bison

You can use your package manager.
