## FTree explanation

This repo can be separated into 3 sections ⬇️
1. the `conf` dir which stores the tmux config file;
2. the `tars` dir which stores the source tars;
3. the `unpacked` dir which isn't here, but will be generated during
   the installation.

## The source

All sources were taken from the official repositories/links:
- `tmux`: https://github.com/tmux/tmux
- `libevent`: https://libevent.org/
- `ncurses`: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html
