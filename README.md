tmux config
===========

Here's my configuration repository for tmux and it's
dependencies ⚙️

## Requirements

Since `tmux.conf` is targeted to tmux software, you'll need tmux and
its dependencies (libs).

The install process vary from distro to distro. You can install it
from you package manager or from source.

## Setting up the config

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nasccped/tmux.conf ~/.config/tmux
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The command above clones the repository into the `.config`
> directory.
>
> Works fine in UNIX like system but can difer in
> [`wsl`](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL) or something.

2. Edit the `tmux.conf`:

The `tmux.conf` file is responsible for tmux changes. Take a look and
change it until reaches your preferences.
